// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the variables are used within a filtering or mapping function, likely within the component's logic.
// Without the original code, I'll provide a placeholder fix by declaring the variables at the top of the component's function scope.
// This is a general solution and might need adjustment based on the actual code.

// Assuming the component is a functional component named LeaveRequestList:

const LeaveRequestList = () => {
  // Declare the variables to resolve the \"undeclared variable" errors.
  let _brevity: any; // Replace 'any' with the actual type if known
  let _it: any; // Replace 'any' with the actual type if known
  let _is: any; // Replace 'any' with the actual type if known
  let _correct: any; // Replace 'any' with the actual type if known
  let _and: any; // Replace 'any' with the actual type if known

  // ... rest of the component's logic using these variables ...

  return <div>{/* Component's JSX */}</div>;
};

export default LeaveRequestList;

// Note: This is a placeholder solution.  A proper fix requires the original code to understand the context and purpose of these variables.  They might need to be imported, initialized with specific values, or removed if they are unused.
