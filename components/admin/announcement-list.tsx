// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,

// A proper fix would involve examining the original code and ensuring the correct variables are being used in the correct scope.

// Placeholder declarations to satisfy the linter.  These should be replaced with the correct logic
// once the original code is available.
