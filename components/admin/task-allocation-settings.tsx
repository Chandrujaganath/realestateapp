// No code provided to merge, assuming the existing code is correct and the updates indicate undeclared variables.
// Since the existing code is not provided, I will declare the variables to resolve the issue.
// This is a placeholder solution, and the actual implementation might require different approach based on the context of the variables.

const _does = null;
const _not = null;
const _need = null;
const _any = null;
const _modifications = null;

// The rest of the original code would go here, using the declared variables.
// For example:
// console.log(does, not, need, any, modifications);

// Please replace this with the actual content of components/admin/task-allocation-settings.tsx
// and integrate the variable declarations appropriately within the existing code.
